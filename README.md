# University_Enrollment_Prediction
NYU-Stern Project to predict US University Enrollment
My team developed a predictive model that predict enrollments in upcoming semesters in the US Higher education institutions based on 2007-2020 Dynamic panel data
Underwent the CRISP-DM methodology of setting up a predictive model, and performed the causal modeling using Arellano-Bond Estimator technique and panel data modeling techniques - especially relevant for the demand estimation and price sensitivity (elasticity) analysis
